This folder contains the datasets generated by Montessori-Instruct, which were also used in our paper:

- `self-instruct`: the dataset generated using [Self-Instruct](https://github.com/yizhongw/self-instruct).
- `montessori-instruct-1`: the dataset generated using Montessori-Instruct in the first iteration, with Llama3-8B as the student model.
- `montessori-instruct-2`: the dataset generated using Montessori-Instruct in the second iteration, with Llama3-8B as the student model.

You can use the dataset above to quickly reproduce the results of our paper.
